## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep onyx (#0A0A0A) to provide a sophisticated, modern base.
- Background color: Dark grey (#1A1A1A), a slightly lighter shade than the primary to add visual depth without overpowering the design.
- Accent color: Mellow gold (#C8B030), an analogous color to the original gold, for highlights and interactive elements to provide warmth and elegance.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a versatile humanist sans-serif for a balance of modern style and readability.
- Use Font Awesome icons for a consistent and modern look across the app.  Icons should match the mellow gold theme to maintain visual harmony.
- Maintain a clean, mobile-first layout with clear sections and ample spacing to ensure readability and ease of navigation.
- Incorporate subtle fade-in animations when loading new content or transitioning between sections for a smooth user experience.
